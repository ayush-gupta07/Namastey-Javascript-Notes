## 📋 Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Keep explanations **clear and beginner-friendly**
- Use **code comments** extensively in examples
- Include **real-world scenarios** where applicable
- Add **interview-style Q&A** sections

### Code Format
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Clear comments explaining the concept
function example() {
    // This demonstrates hoisting behavior
    console.log(myVar); // undefined (not an error)
    var myVar = 5;
}

// ❌ Avoid: Uncommented or unclear code
function example() {
    console.log(myVar);
    var myVar = 5;
}
```

### Markdown Structure
- Use proper headings hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Include code blocks with language specification
- Add emojis sparingly for better readability
- Keep line length reasonable (under 100 characters when possible)

### Episode Structure
Each episode should follow this structure:
1. **Introduction** - What the episode covers
2. **Detailed Explanation** - Core concepts with examples
3. **Code Examples** - Practical demonstrations
4. **Interview Questions** - Common interview scenarios
5. **Key Takeaways** - Summary points
