# 📘 Episode 12: Famous Interview Questions ft. Closures

Closures are one of the most important and tricky concepts in JavaScript. This episode covers famous interview questions that revolve around closures. Below, you'll find detailed explanations, code examples, and the reasoning behind each concept.

## ❓ What is a Closure in JavaScript?

> A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.

In simpler terms, a **function bundled together with its surrounding (lexical) environment** forms a closure.

```js
function outer() {
  var a = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  return inner;
}
outer()(); // 10
```

🔍 Here, `inner()` retains access to `a` even after `outer()` has finished execution.

---

## 🔄 Does the Order of Variable Declaration Matter?

```js
function outer() {
  function inner() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  var a = 10;
  return inner;
}
outer()(); // 10
```

✅ Yes, the closure still works because JavaScript handles the declaration and hoisting. Execution context is maintained.

---

## 🆚 Does `var` vs `let` Affect Closures?

```js
function outer() {
  let a = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  return inner;
}
outer()(); // 10
```

Both `var` and `let` support closures. The key difference lies in their scope (`var` is function-scoped, `let` is block-scoped), but closures work the same way.

---

## 📥 Do Closures Capture Arguments?

```js
function outer(str) {
  let a = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(a, str);
  }
  return inner;
}
outer("Hello There")(); // 10 "Hello There"
```

Yes! Closures capture both local variables and parameters passed to the outer function.

---

## 🧭 How Deep Can a Closure Access?

```js
function outest() {
  var c = 20;
  function outer(str) {
    let a = 10;
    function inner() {
      console.log(a, c, str);
    }
    return inner;
  }
  return outer;
}
outest()("Hello There")(); // 10 20 "Hello There"
```

📌 Closures can access all variables from their entire chain of outer lexical environments.

---

## ❗ Conflict in Variable Names?

```js
let a = 100;
function outest() {
  var c = 20;
  function outer(str) {
    let a = 10;
    function inner() {
      console.log(a, c, str);
    }
    return inner;
  }
  return outer;
}
outest()("Hello There")(); // 10 20 "Hello There"
```

Even if a variable with the same name exists globally (`a = 100`), closures access the nearest available variable in their lexical scope (`a = 10` here).

---

## 🎯 Real-World Uses of Closures

Closures enable:

- Module Design Pattern
- Currying
- Memoization
- Data hiding and encapsulation
- Handling asynchronous operations (e.g. `setTimeout`)

---

## 🔐 Data Hiding with Closures

Without Closure:
```js
var count = 0;
function increment(){
  count++;
}
```

With Closure:
```js
function counter() {
  var count = 0;
  function increment(){
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }
  return increment;
}
var inc = counter();
inc(); // 1
inc(); // 2
```

🔒 `count` is now private and cannot be modified directly outside the function.

---

## 🛠️ Scalable Solution using Constructor Functions

```js
function Counter() {
  var count = 0;

  this.incrementCounter = function() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }

  this.decrementCounter = function() {
    count--;
    console.log(count);
  }
}

const c1 = new Counter();
c1.incrementCounter(); // 1
c1.incrementCounter(); // 2
c1.decrementCounter(); // 1
```

🏗️ Now `count` is encapsulated and accessible via controlled public methods.

---

## ❌ Disadvantages of Closures

- **Memory Leaks**: Variables inside closures are not garbage collected if there are still references to the closure.
- **Overhead**: Too many closures = too much memory usage

Example:
```js
function a() {
  var x = 0;
  return function b() {
    console.log(x);
  };
}
var y = a(); // y holds reference to x
y();
```

🧹 JS engines like V8 are smart and clean up unused closures when possible.

## ✅ Summary: Everything You Learned About Closures

| Concept | Key Points |
|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Function + lexical environment |
| **Hoisting Impact** | Closure still works regardless of variable declaration order |
| **`var` vs `let`** | No difference for closures, just scope changes |
| **Closure Scope Chain** | Can access variables from all parent scopes |
| **Real-World Use Cases** | Modules, Memoization, Data Privacy, Currying, `setTimeout` |
| **Constructor Use** | Enables object-style data encapsulation |
| **Pitfalls** | Memory retention due to closed-over variables |
| **Garbage Collection** | Smart JS engines clean up unused references |
