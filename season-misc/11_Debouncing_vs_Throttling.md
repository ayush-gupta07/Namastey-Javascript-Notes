# 📦 Episode 11: Debouncing vs Throttling in JavaScript

## 🔍 Overview

When building performant and responsive applications, especially in web development, **debouncing** and **throttling** are two essential techniques for rate-limiting function calls, particularly for **event-driven** interactions like scrolling, resizing, or typing.

---

## ⚡ Debouncing

### 📘 Definition
Debouncing ensures that a function is **only executed once** after a **specified delay** has passed **since the last time** the function was invoked.

### ✅ Use Case
Useful when you want to wait until the user has **stopped performing an action** before firing the function.

### 📌 Real-life Examples
- Search input field where you want to trigger an API **only when the user stops typing**.
- Resizing the window and adjusting the layout **after** the resize ends.

### 🧠 Code Example
```js
function debounce(func, delay = 300) {
  let timeoutId;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      func.apply(this, args);
    }, delay);
  };
}
```

## 🚀 Throttling

### 📘 Definition
Throttling ensures that a function is called **at most once every specified interval**, regardless of how many times it's triggered during that interval.

### ✅ Use Case
Useful when you want to **limit the number of executions** of a function at regular intervals.

### 📌 Real-life Examples
- Logging scroll position every 500ms instead of on every pixel scroll.
- Rate-limiting window resize events.

### 🧠 Code Example
```js
function throttle(func, interval = 300) {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return function (...args) {
    const now = new Date().getTime();
    if (now - lastCall >= interval) {
      lastCall = now;
      func.apply(this, args);
    }
  };
}
```

## 🧾 Summary Table

| Feature       | Debouncing                              | Throttling                             |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Trigger Style | Fires once **after** inactivity delay    | Fires every `X` ms during continuous trigger |
| Use Case      | Search inputs, text validation, resize end | Scroll, mousemove, periodic polling     |
| Timer Behavior| Resets timer after every event           | Ignores calls during wait interval      |
| Frequency     | Least frequent                           | More consistent, fixed interval         |

## 🤔 When to Use What?

| Scenario                          | Recommendation |
|----------------------------------|----------------|
| Auto-suggest in search           | Debounce       |
| Save draft after inactivity      | Debounce       |
| Window resizing optimization     | Throttle       |
| Tracking scroll for animation    | Throttle       |
| Logging mouse movement data      | Throttle       |
| Typing API call                  | Debounce       |

## 💬 Interview Traps & Common Misconceptions

1. **Debounce != Delay** – Debounce waits for **no more triggers**, not a fixed delay.
2. **Throttle != Fixed Timeout** – It allows only **1 call per interval**, not just delaying calls.
3. You can actually combine both in some rare cases.
4. Debouncing is preferred for **final actions**, throttling for **continuous monitoring**.
5. Forgetting to handle `this` and arguments in custom implementations can break context.

## 🧠 Interview Questions

1. **What’s the key difference between debouncing and throttling?**
   - Debouncing delays execution **until inactivity ends**.
   - Throttling **limits** execution to one per interval.

2. **Where would you use debounce over throttle?**
   - When you want **only one final call** after a burst of events (like input).

3. **Can you implement debounce and throttle manually?**
   - Yes, using `setTimeout`, `clearTimeout`, and timestamps.
